# Reef Hunter #

Fun, simple little platformer game I made with kaboom a while back.

There is bad code galore, and poor performance is abundant. Nevertheless, it is still quite fun.

I wasted too much of my time playing this game once I had found it in my old repls. Perhaps you will find this project equally enjoyable.

### Controls ###

Use WASD to move, space to shoot. Everything else, you will discover on your own.
